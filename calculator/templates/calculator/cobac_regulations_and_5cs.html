            </ul>
            Otherwise, the loan is maintained in its initial classification category for a period of 90 days, starting from the first maturity of the consolidation loan. Its reclassification among performing loans can only occur at the end of this transitional period, provided that no unpaid instalment is registered during this period. Provisions made prior to restructuring or rescheduling may only be brought forward at the end of the transitional period.
            With the exception of State-owed defaulted loans, any unpaid instalment during the transitional period shall lead to the automatic decommissioning of the outstanding instalment of the restructured or rescheduled loan.
            The loan initially classified as doubtful shall remain in this category when an unpaid instalment occurs during the transitional period and must also be fully provisioned.
            The loan initially classified as State-owed defaulted loan shall remain in this category in the event of an unpaid instalment during the transitional period.
